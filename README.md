# Data Enrichment Hackathon, Naturalis, Leiden

## 17–21 March 2014

Two developers from [RBG Kew](http://www.kew.org) attended the [Data Enrichment Hackathon](http://wiki.pro-ibiosphere.eu/wiki/Data_enrichment_hackathon,_March_17-21_2014)
held at Naturalis in Leiden in March 2014: Nicky Nicolson and Matthew Blissett.

Both worked in [Task Group 3](http://wiki.pro-ibiosphere.eu/wiki/Task_Groups#Task_Group_3:_Links_to.2Ffrom_specimens_and_names) on links between specimens and names.

Nicky wrote a [Neo4J Graph Gist for taxonomy](http://gist.neo4j.org/?9645618).

Matt worked on developing Kew’s [Reconciliation and Matching Framework](https://github.com/RBGKew/Reconciliation-and-Matching-Framework) to expose specimen data as an OpenRefine
Reconciliation Service.
